// Halflife 2 custom sound mixers.
// These Sound Mixers are referenced by name from Soundscapes, and are used to provide
// custom volume control over various sound categories, called 'mix groups'

// "GROUPRULES" specifies the rules for inclusion of a sound in a mix group.
// Rules are checked sequentially (from top to bottom). All fields must match
// in a row in order for a sound to match the group.  A sound my be included 
// in up to 8 mix groups.

// LIMITS: 
//		up to 64 unique mix groups
//		up to 76 group rules entries
//		up to 32 sound mixers
//		all strings are limited to 31 characters!

// NOTE2: at runtime, you can display the classname of the sound source by
// setting snd_showclassname 1 in the console.

// NOTE3: main character dialog during critical scenes is ducked using a separate code path which, when
// active, temporarilly disables mixer ducking (prevent double ducking).  
// Lower priority sounds are ducked by higher priority sounds, if "is ducked" is enabled. 
// Only sounds with "causes ducking" enabled can cause a lower priority sound to be ducked.
